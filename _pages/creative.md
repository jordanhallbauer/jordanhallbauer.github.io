Below are pieces of my poetry, prose, and mixed media works that have been published in various lit & art mags.<br>

**_Early march and a light leak_**

>eyes brown all winter flicker to green in the sun. i flicker into a feeling like warm water, something easier <br>
than in months. a light leak, i think. <br>

>thin cracked light pink lips on darker fuller smoother ones. i sip a beer and tell you that the spring sun <br>
always screams, “to live half the year in winter is to hurt!” and i resent ohio. i think i even remember <br>
unidentifiable sadness on a sled in snow once, very long ago. does sadness change or only grow? how much have i projected back, how far? <br>
you tell me that maybe people don’t experience the same universe differently but, rather, all of our quite <br>
different universes coalesce to form a generally intelligible human experience, only the berenstein blips <br>
show otherwise. your memory is whatever you want it to be, no one will ever know the difference. <br>

> when i saw brown did you see green? <br>
do you see death like me? <br>

> we smile talking of a shared sunday sorrow since childhood, a young unknowing still unsolved, the <br>
expanding unrealization that all life ends eventually, weekly unacceptance of the human condition.<br>

>> (to know that you will die! one sunset will be your last, a sunday craning downward into <br>
darkness, time won’t spring forward or upward again. <br>
if death is like a sunday, as i’ve dreamed it is, to die won’t be a flash but a sinking <br>
into the sea. <br>
how many times have you stood knee deep in still warm water, life beneath your feet but <br>
eyes glued unblinking until you cry to the farthest thing you can see. how does the sun move <br>
so slow all day and then slip down with such momentum, right when you realize you’ll miss it the most. <br>
the green flash is in your head, false memory to make darkness seem <br>
supernatural, just another meaning-maker.) <br>

> what a thing to think about even as days get longer, a thing to only consider on the momentary upswing, i laugh.

**_land marks_** <br>
*spring 2018, CW*
> deep red blood seeds planted everywhere <br>
  in this town i could make a million left turns <br>
  to circle the places we watched each other bloom.<br>

> old landmarks like the living <br>
  room where we spent the coldest winter,<br>
  sipping tea you told me that Rumi might be <br>
  a little too holy for me. i skimmed him anyway, <br>
  i would eat anything you’d dog-eared. <br>
  *you are the universe in ecstatic motion*, <br>
  i whispered so i wouldn’t forget.  <br>

> petal, pedal faster now, we breezed biking down <br>
  every road in town before crashing <br>
  on benches, we laid on our backs,<br>
  to talk about the people we love and their parents,<br>
  plans to protect each other. <br>

> past your house, a haven <br>
  in the warmer winter when i couldn’t sleep <br>
  alone as i quietly said over your kitchen table <br>
  that everyone seemed like a threat <br>
  and you told me that made sense.<br>
  we lived half a block away,<br>
  i jogged the stretch twice a day <br>
  to sleep in the room below yours. <br>

> only memories of the taboo places, things left behind <br>
  at my rapist’s apartment, <br>
  things that you went back to collect: <br>
  a wallet and glitter placed in vials,<br>
  careful evidence for collective revenge. <br>
  if cops can’t help us then curses will, <br>
  i scream as we burn bay leaves <br>
  and crush ashes into carpet. <br>

> soft radicalization, we read religiously, <br>
 took to the streets and made homes in between. <br>
 a friend told a friend told you told me <br>
 that post trauma, it helps if you buy new sheets. <br>
 we moved, marched, condemned white landmarks <br>
 then crashed into bed. <br>

>living together in seasons, we moved between bedrooms <br>
 shared sites of self-worship. <br>
 how holy, to make soup in the summer <br>
 with you.

> alone now, i wonder at how <br>
pomegranates don’t taste so pretty <br>
without three, four pairs of hands <br>
dipping, dripping, gently tugging,<br>
looking at each other as our fingers pull off the soft flesh parts <br>
left stuck to the seeds. <br>

> how tightly my emotional geography is tied <br>
to the places we ate fruits. <br>
