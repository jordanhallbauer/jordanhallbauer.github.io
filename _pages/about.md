I'm a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara in the Latin American and Iberian Studies program. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Miami University (Ohio) in English Literature and International Studies, with minors in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Spanish. I'm currently interested in poetry and social movements in Nicaragua.
