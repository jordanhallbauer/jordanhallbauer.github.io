I'm a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara in the Latin American and Iberian Studies program. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Miami University (Ohio) in English Literature and International Studies, with minors in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Spanish. <br>
<br>
My research looks at the relationship between literature and social movements in Nicaragua, particularly social movement mobilization beginning after 2013 until the present day and culminating in the April 2018 protests against Ortega's proposed pension reforms. I'm most interested in how the expansion of transnational capital and a changing relationship between citizen and the state are negotiated and mediated through literary texts, with the hypothesis that political change is shaped through not only the narratives and arguments of “political” poetry but also through the poetic representation of social mood and affect. <br>
<br>
This site operates as a space to post updates about current activist work and policy changes in Nicaragua, as well as a place to collect and share related creative publications. My research looks at literary works of all forms but particularly poetry, testimonio, musical verse, and prose published by Nicaraguans, Nicaraguan-Americans, and Nicaraguan migrants elsewhere which respond to and engage with the 2018-2019 protests. The works shared on this site are NOT my own. All work is cited and attributed to the proper source to the best of my knowledge. My intent is not to posit this work as my own nor to claim ownership over these works. I simply hope that by offering an organized assemblage of literary works published on a variety of platforms, it will  be easier for folks to access and engage with Nicaraguan literary works. <br>
