# SUMMARY:
I’m a graduate student in the Latin American and Iberian Studies program at UC, Santa Barbara with an undergraduate background in English Literature, International Studies, Spanish, and Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies.

# RELATED EXPERIENCE:
## Service-Learning Semester Abroad ……………. Jan. 2016 – May 2016 / Granada, Nicaragua
Study Spanish and Latin American history, politics, and health in Granada, Nicaragua for four months. Volunteer at a rural public school three times a week to teach English and tutor local students.
## Undergraduate Summer Scholars Award ….. July 2017 - August 2017 / Chiang Mai, Thailand
Received a research grant to work with Dr. Sebro in Thailand. Helped administer ethnographic interviews in the Koung Jor refugee camp and co-presented our research (titled “The Touristic Mobilities of Migrants in the Thai-Burma Border-Zone”) at the 10th International Convention of Asia Scholars in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Completed 45 hours of intensive Thai language study at Chiang Mai University.

## Inklings Writing Director & Editorial Board Member.... Sept. 2015 - May 2018 / Oxford, OH
Evaluate and discuss original literature and art submitted by undergraduate students with fellow board members to determine which pieces constitute publication in our magazine. As Writing Director, I render anonymous the submitted pieces for board consideration and communicate with contributors. As an executive board member, I engage with fellow board members to discuss the technical and thematic attributes of literary submissions, and to offer interpretations of submitted work.

## TA for “Introduction to Latin American and Iberian Studies” (LAIS 10) .. Fall 2018 / UCSB
Attend lectures, lead two discussion sections, prepare discussion section weekly plans, correspond daily via email with students and the professor, hold regular office hours for students. The material in this class explores the broad history of Latin American regions and cultures from pre-colonial times until present.
# RELEVANT WORK:
## “The Touristic Mobilities of Migrants: a Comparative Analysis of Nicaragua and Myanmar”
Co-writing a chapter with Dr. Tani Sebro (sebroth@miamioh.edu) that will be featured in the volume The Geopolitics of Tourism (Mostafanezhad, Norum, Córdoba). The book will feature a range of studies examining the imaginaries, affects, and infrastructures of geopolitical tourism. The chapter written by Dr. Sebro and I utilizes ethnographic data from our work in Thailand and in Nicaragua to create a conceptual argument that seeks to decolonize the category of ‘tourist.’ We do this by identifying the racialized language which often refers to people as ‘migrants,’ ‘expats,’ or ‘aliens’ rather than as ‘tourists,’ and we request a more just and inclusive grammar of mobility. Pending publication in 2019.
