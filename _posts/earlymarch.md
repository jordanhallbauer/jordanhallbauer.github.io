**_Early march and a light leak_** <br>
*spring 2018*

>eyes brown all winter flicker to green in the sun. i flicker into a feeling like warm water, something easier <br>
than in months. a light leak, i think. <br>

>thin cracked light pink lips on darker fuller smoother ones. i sip a beer and tell you that the spring sun <br>
always screams, “to live half the year in winter is to hurt!” and i resent ohio. i think i even remember <br>
unidentifiable sadness on a sled in snow once, very long ago. does sadness change or only grow? how much have i projected back, how far? <br>
you tell me that maybe people don’t experience the same universe differently but, rather, all of our quite <br>
different universes coalesce to form a generally intelligible human experience, only the berenstein blips <br>
show otherwise. your memory is whatever you want it to be, no one will ever know the difference. <br>

> when i saw brown did you see green? <br>
do you see death like me? <br>

> we smile talking of a shared sunday sorrow since childhood, a young unknowing still unsolved, the <br>
expanding unrealization that all life ends eventually, weekly unacceptance of the human condition.<br>

>> (to know that you will die! one sunset will be your last, a sunday craning downward into <br>
darkness, time won’t spring forward or upward again. <br>
if death is like a sunday, as i’ve dreamed it is, to die won’t be a flash but a sinking <br>
into the sea. <br>
how many times have you stood knee deep in still warm water, life beneath your feet but <br>
eyes glued unblinking until you cry to the farthest thing you can see. how does the sun move <br>
so slow all day and then slip down with such momentum, right when you realize you’ll miss it the most. <br>
the green flash is in your head, false memory to make darkness seem <br>
supernatural, just another meaning-maker.) <br>

> what a thing to think about even as days get longer, a thing to only consider on the momentary upswing, i laugh.
